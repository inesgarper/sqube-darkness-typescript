# Sqube Darkness

This project is a videogame based on the original Sqube Darkness, 
in which you are a cube that travels around a map dodging enemies. 
Among them, obstacles, bubbling holes, or even flying drones that, 
if they shine their spotlight on you, shoot you mercilessly. 
Run, jump, hide and do whatever it takes to reach the end of the map and win the game. 

Use the arrow keys to move around the map and jump over obstacles. 
By pressing the 'X' key you can turn off the spotlights of the drones, 
and with the 'Z' key, you will become invisible and immune to any enemy.

Good luck!

We used TypeScript to create this game.
